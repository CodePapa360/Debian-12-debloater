# Debian-10

Debian 10 is the best os (in my opinion) but have some junk software installed by default.

Lack of some good software but this new version is easy to use and really stable.

sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal -y &&
sudo apt-get install seahorse -y &&
sudo apt-get install vlc -y &&
sudo apt-get autoremove &&
exit

There is not gui update so run :

echo "Debian 10 update"
echo "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
sudo apt update &&
sudo apt upgrade &&
exit

"iso usb sdc.sh" is an partial GUI to create bootable usb stick, it write to SDC !!!

Debian 10 junk remover. Sh script to remove junk or bloatware softwares.

Just run .sh file and remove bloatwares.
