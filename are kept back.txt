    apt list --upgradable

    This will show a list of packages that can be upgraded.

Next, do this:

    Start at the beginning of the list with the first package and type:

    sudo apt-get install package-name-here

    This will run through the installation process and pull/install dependencies.

After that process completes, do this:

    apt list --upgradable

    This will again show which packages can be upgraded. Your list of packages should now be decreasing. Follow the list of packages and type apt list --upgradable after each package install. This should only take a couple of minutes to complete.
